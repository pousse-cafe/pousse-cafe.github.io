	  <h1>Pousse-Café Framework</h1>
	  <p>Pousse-Café is a framework assisting you in writing applications following Domain Driven Design methodology. While DDD
	    has proven to be useful in writing code representing complex business rules and/or having strong scalability requirements,
	    it is not always easy to apply given the number of transversal issues that need to be addressed. Pousse-Café's purpose
	    is to solve most of those issues allowing developers to focus on the Domain and its implementation.
